abstract = {The paper introduces the idea of Bayesian quantile regression employing a likelihood function that is based on the asymmetric Laplace distribution. It is shown that irrespective of the original distribution of the data, the use of the asymmetric Laplace distribution is a very natural and effective way for modelling Bayesian quantile regression. The paper also demonstrates that improper uniform priors for the unknown model parameters yield a proper joint posterior. The approach is illustrated via a simulated and two real data sets.}

abstract = {SUMMARY This paper develops a Bayesian method for quantile regression for dichotomous response data. The frequentist approach to this type of regression has proven problematic in both optimizing the objective function and making inferences on the parameters. By accepting additional distributional assumptions on the error terms, the Bayesian method proposed sets the problem in a parametric framework in which these problems are avoided. To test the applicability of the method, we ran two Monte Carlo experiments and applied it to Horowitz's (1993) often studied work-trip mode choice dataset. Compared to previous estimates for the latter dataset, the method proposed leads to a different economic interpretation. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract={After its introduction by Koenker and Basset (1978), quantile regression has become an important and popular tool to investigate the conditional response distribution in regression. The R package bayesQR contains a number of routines to estimate quantile regression parameters using a Bayesian approach based on the asymmetric Laplace distribution. The package contains functions for the typical quantile regression with continuous dependent variable, but also supports quantile regression for binary dependent variables. For both types of dependent variables, an approach to variable selection using the adaptive lasso approach is provided. For the binary quantile regression model, the package also contains a routine that calculates the fitted probabilities for each vector of predictors. In addition, functions for summarizing the results, creating traceplots, posterior histograms and drawing quantile plots are included. This paper starts with a brief overview of the theoretical background of the models used in the bayesQR package. The main part of this paper discusses the computational problems that arise in the implementation of the procedure and illustrates the usefulness of the package through selected examples.},
